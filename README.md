# Randomness Library for Go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/plombardi89/rando.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/plombardi89/rando)

I found myself often writing little functions in Go to return Random data because the Random generation library is too
lightweight. So I threw some of this stuff in a library.
